# ðŸ“Š Stock Price Prediction App ðŸ“ˆ

This app predicts the future stock prices of various companies using advanced machine learning models. With this tool, you can analyze historical data and make predictions using two popular models: **Prophet** and **AutoRegressive (AR)**.Currently, the app supports predictions for only 10 companies but there might be changes in the future! 

## ðŸ§° Models used

The following frameworks and modules have been used to make this app-

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web interface and displaying data 
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling stock data 
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive and beautiful data visualizations 
- **Prophet**: For time series forecasting and stock price prediction 
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical modeling, including AutoRegressive (AR) and other time series models 
- **yfinance**: For fetching real-time stock data 


## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
* **Real-Time Data**: Fetch live stock data for selected companies 
* **Visualizing Forecast**: Display future stock price predictions alongside historical data 
* **Prophet Model**: Make time-series predictions with the powerful Prophet model 
* **AutoRegressive (AR) Model**: Predict stock trends using the statistical AR model from Statsmodels 
* **Customizable Settings**: Select the stock, time period, and data interval for flexible analysis


## ðŸŒŸ How to Run the App Locally
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samriddhinechali1/stock-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run stock_predictor.py
   ```


## ðŸš€ Conclusion
This app provides a simple yet powerful tool for predicting stock prices using time-series forecasting techniques. While Iâ€™ve used the Prophet model and the AutoRegressive (AR) model to generate predictions, I have also experimented with the ARIMA model. However, the results from ARIMA were unsatisfactory, so I decided not to include it in the app for now. Despite this, I plan to revisit ARIMA or explore other models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to further improve accuracy in future updates.

## ðŸ“Œ Note
Remember, this app is just for funâ€”donâ€™t bet your life savings on these predictions! Real stock market decisions should always come with solid research and professional advice. ðŸ˜‰
